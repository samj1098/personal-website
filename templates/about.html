    <section class="mb-4">
        <p>
            I'm a Junior at Arizona State University majoring in Computer Science, specializing in Software Engineering and Big Data. I'm currently planning on pursuing the 4+1 program to earn my Master's degree while completing my Bachelor's, although I have yet to reach the point where I need to apply yet (next semester). My coursework has included advanced algorithms, systems security, data structures, and full-stack web development.

        <h3>Extracurricular Activities</h3>
    
        <p>
            From 2014 to 2023, I was a dedicated member and co-director of the <strong>Catfish Bay WaterSki Team</strong> in Sioux Falls, SD — a team of 45–55 athletes focused on high-level performance, community engagement, and outdoor recreation.

        </ul>
        <p>

            <h3>Passion for Fitness</h3>
            <p>
                I'm a dedicated CrossFit athlete who thrives on physical and mental challenges. I've competed in the <strong>CrossFit Open</strong> multiple times and proudly ranked in the <strong>Top 75th Percentile of athletes</strong> worldwide — a reflection of my consistent training, competitive mindset, and drive to improve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Training with the goal of qualifying for the <strong>CrossFit Games</strong> has taught me how to embrace discomfort, push through limits, and maintain discipline over long periods — qualities I bring into my academic and professional life. Whether it's perfecting a muscle-up or debugging a tricky algorithm, I enjoy tackling tough problems head-on.

        <h3>Cloud and Security Enthusiast</h3>
        <p>
            I’m passionate about cloud infrastructure and recently earned my <strong>AWS Certified Developer – Associate</strong> certification. I’ve been diving into cloud-native technologies to understand how modern systems scale, operate securely, and stay resilient.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, the website you're viewing right now is my <strong>first real-world deployment on AWS</strong> — hosted using services like <strong>Elastic Beanstalk</strong> and <strong>RDS PostgreSQL</strong>. This project gave me hands-on experience setting up cloud environments, managing deployment pipelines, and using AWS tools like EC2, S3, and CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I’m still early in my AWS journey, building and deploying this site from the ground up gave me valuable insight into how full-stack apps operate in the cloud. I'm excited to build more complex cloud-based projects and explore areas like serverless computing and infrastructure as code.

        <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
        <p>
            When I’m not coding or training, I enjoy hiking, tanning under the Arizona sun, and spending time outdoors. Whether it’s pushing limits in the gym or enjoying a peaceful trail, I’m always pursuing balance between productivity and personal wellness.
